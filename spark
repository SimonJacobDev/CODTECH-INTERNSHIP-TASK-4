## **AIM:**

To install, deploy and configure apache spark

---

## **Modes of Apache Spark Deployment**

### **1. Standalone Mode in Apache Spark**

Spark is deployed on the top of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
For computations, Spark and Map Reduce run in parallel for the Spark jobs submitted to the cluster.

### **2. Hadoop YARN / Mesos**

Apache Spark runs on Mesos or YARN (Yet another Resource Navigator, one of the key features in the second-generation Hadoop) without any root-access or pre-installation.
It integrates Spark on top Hadoop stack that is already present on the system.

### **3. SIMR (Spark in Map Reduce)**

This is an add-on to the standalone deployment where Spark jobs can be launched by the user and they can use the spark shell without any administrative access.

## **SPARK INSTALLATION:**

### **Prerequisite:**

Fully Functional Hadoop Framework

---

### **Step 1: Download Spark**

Download the spark distribution file:
`spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz`

---

### **Step 2: untar the zip file**

```
msu@msu-VirtualBox:~$ tar -xvzf spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz
```

---

### **Step 3: Configuring Spark Environment Variables**

Open .bashrc:

```
msu@msu-VirtualBox:~$ sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
```

Append the following Spark environment variables to the .bashrc file:

```
export SPARK_HOME=/home/msu/spark
export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin
```

Reload the file using:

```
msu@msu-VirtualBox:~$ source ~/.bashrc
```

Start Spark shell:

```
msu@msu-VirtualBox:~$ spark-shell
```

---

## **WORD COUNT PROGRAM: (Scala)**

```
scala> val data = sc.textFile("sparkdata.txt")

scala> val splitdata = data.flatMap(line => line.split(" "))

scala> val mapdata = splitdata.map(word => (word, 1))

scala> val reducedata = mapdata.reduceByKey(_ + _)

scala> reducedata.collect
```

---

## **EXPLANATION OF WORD COUNT PROGRAM (FULL SIMPLE EXPLANATION)**

* `val data = sc.textFile("sparkdata.txt")` loads the text file into an RDD so Spark can process it line by line.
* `flatMap(line => line.split(" "))` splits every line into individual words and flattens the result into a single list of words.
* `map(word => (word, 1))` converts each word into a key-value pair `(word, 1)` for counting.
* `reduceByKey(_+_)` adds together all 1s for the same word, giving the total count for each word.
* Example: `"hello spark hello"` → `("hello",2), ("spark",1)`.

---

## **RESULT:**

Thus, Apache Spark was installed and word count program was successfully executed.
